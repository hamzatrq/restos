# @restos/sync-gateway

**Owning spec: `specs/01-kernel-sync.md` — read it before modifying anything here (AGENTS.md routing).**

- PROTECTED PATH (20 §4.4). The cloud end of the sync protocol; scales separately from api.
- **IMPLEMENTED (Wave 0).** See `README.md` for the module map (merge gateway, auth/registry, quarantine outbox, Auditor) and the six-table Postgres schema. PROTECTED path — senior review on every change; Postgres/Testcontainers to run.
